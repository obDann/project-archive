# TTC January Delay Analysis

An in-depth analysis of train delays within the TTC for the month of January

### Highlights
* Broad Managerial Questions asked (resulting in ways to break down a question):
  1. During which periods of the day do delays occur more often?
  2. Is there any correlation between time of day and total delay time?
  3. What are the top 10 stations that suffer the most delays? Consider both the total number of delay occurrences and length of delays
  4. What are the top 10 reasons for delays?
  5. How many times per day did a delay occur in January? What is the average delay time per day?
  6. Is there any correlation between day of the week and the total number of delays?
  7. Is there any correlation between day of the week and average delay time? How about time of the day an minimum gaps?
  8. How has the number of delays progressed per week during January? Did the number of delays increase, decrease or remain stable as weeks progressed?
  9. What was the worst day in January in terms of total delay time? What reason would you attribute to this phenomenon? Answer the same question, considering the best day in terms of total delay time
  10. What are the top 10 vehicles associated with longer delays? Is there any link between vehicles and delays? What reason could you attribute to this longer delay time?
* Basic graphing (histograms, bar-plot, scatter-plot with line of best fit)


### Lessons learned after submitting this project
* Always break down high-level managerial questions
* It is okay to investigate on a tangent if time permits
* Do not lock yourself with just the data provided, always have research as an open option
  * When creating this report, it was helpful to investigate:
    * Geographical locations
    * Timestamps
    * Potential events that occurred on the time stamp
* Use Economic intuition (Price Theory) whenever possible to appropriately make/create solutions/decisions

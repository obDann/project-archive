//Sprint 5 Backloag
July 17th to July 23rd

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

to a specified file which will create and write to the file if it doesn't
exist or overwrite the file's contents if it does exist.

Bc) As a user, a user can redirect the output of any command (except exit)
to a specified file which will create and write to the file if it doesn't
exist or append to the file's contents on a newline if it does exist.

Ab) As a user, a user must be able to print text to the shell

Ba) As a user, a user must be able see all of a path's sub directories given
 a path or multiple paths (in both contexts of relative and absolute path)

by providing an exclamation point(!) followed by the history number of the
command that was executed.


Specific tasks to be accomplished:
Bb-1 (Output) Write the unit test for redirection and overwriting
Bc-1 (Output) Write the unit test for redirection and appending
Ab-1 (Echo) Refactor Echo (and other commands implemented in 2A) so that
it does not directly print to the shell and works with its output queue (must
also make unit tests for these commands)
Ba-1 (Ls) implement the functionality of "ls -R"
Af-1 (Ls) re-implement existing code to work with the requirements of ls (as
this has failed from 2A; it must print out the path, a colon and then a
following a new line)
Aac-1 (Directory) Only make directory names to be alphanumeric
Ak-1 (Directory) Make the unit test for directory
Ac-1 (File) Make the unit test for file
Bk-1 (Grep) Create base code for printing lines in a file if -R is not 
supplied
Bk-2 (Grep) Create base code for printing lines in a file if -R is supplied
Bd-3 (Curl) Create JUnit test for curl command
Bf-1 (Mv) write unit test for Mv output error messages
Bj-1 (Cp) write unit test for Cp output error messages
Aaa-1 (Find) write unit test for Find
Ag-1 (FileSystem) complete the unit test for FileSystem
Ag-2 (FileSystem) refactor some method so it fits the 30 lines limit
Ai-1 (Exit) Add base and man code for Exit class
Ai-2 (Console) Remove previous way of checking for exit command
Ai-3 (ValidData) Remove previous way of checking for exit command
Be-1 (Console) Write base code for ! (command substitution) method
Be-2 (HistoryContainer) Write base code for getting a single command
Be-3 (Console) Integrate command substitution in Console's input loop

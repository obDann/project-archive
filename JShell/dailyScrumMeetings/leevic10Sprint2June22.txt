What did I do last time?
- I worked on implementng polymorphsim in the directory class so that both directory and file objects can be stored in a directory.

What do I plan to do now?
- I plan on creating the directory stack class so that the pushd and popd commands can be implemented. After the directory stack class is completed I plan on creating the base code for pushd and popd.

Am I blocked on anything?
- I am currently not blocked on anything.

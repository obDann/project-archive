What did I do last time:
    - fixed history command error for large numbers
    - made Console work with reflection and hashtables
    - discussed how to implement output redirection with Dann

What do I plan to do now?
    - work on ! command
    - work on integrating Output with Console

Am I blocked on anything?
    - just a lot of refactoring is needed, so need to think carefully about
      certain things

What did I do last time:
    - I was sick; just spent past few days recovering

What do I plan to do now?
    - bascially just catch up
    - anything leftover from dongsiboSprintJune19.txt
    - sprint2 things
    - documentation for my class and adding the honor code thing to all files if not
    - added already

Am I blocked on anything?
    - no, just need to take a look at all code available so far to gain an
    - understanding of where the project is at and if we need to modify anything

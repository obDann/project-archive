What did I do last time?
-Base code for FileSystemObject
-Refactored File

What do I plan to do now?
-Add an error class for the Directory so that same named files/directories are
not in the directory
-Base code for cat
-Base code for echo
-Base code for ls
-Base code for cd
-Base code for pwd

Am I blocked on anything?
-Adding the error class for Directory; time is scarce
-ls and cd may be tricky to handle; will communicate with team members and
 review documentation
-May need to communicate with the group about the design (constructors cannot
 return objects in Java)

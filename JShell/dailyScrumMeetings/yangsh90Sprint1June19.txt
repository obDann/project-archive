What did I do last time?
- worked on Output class
- started base code for Path class and its basic methods

What do I plan to do now?
- rename Path to FileSystem
- adjust FileSystem according newly added class FileSystemObject
- create test cases for FileSystem
- finish FileSystem
- update crcCards

Am I blocked on anything?
- need some basic method from FileSystemObject and Directory class
  before I can continue working on FileSystem

What did I do last time?
-Reinforced code for the output class
-Created base code for output queue class and its unit test


What do I plan to do now?
-Refactor delegated classes from 2A so that it works with the output class
-Complete the functionality of "ls -R"

Am I blocked on anything?
-Needed to discuss how output queue is worked with the commands (which is
 discussed with group members)
-Will talk to group members for any additional help

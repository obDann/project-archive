What did I do last time:
    - finished implementing base code for history command
    - added method to assign proper command objects to a Command reference var in
      Console i.e. to actually run commands

What do I plan to do now?
    - documenting and testing code
    - continue to work on the calling code in Console e.g. the code for executing
      commands in general

Am I blocked on anything?
    - some command's execute methods are not working exactly as wanted, affecting
      code in Console

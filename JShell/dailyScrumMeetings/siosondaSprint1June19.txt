What did I do last time?
-Base code for the File class
-Factory methods for the File class

What do I plan to do now?
-Re-adjustment of the file class due to a new class "File System Object"
-Creating the base code for the File System Object
-Creating UML diagrams for the team to view

Am I blocked on anything?
-None for now, but it may be expected that I will be for File System Object.
Communication with the team is key to get around obstacles.

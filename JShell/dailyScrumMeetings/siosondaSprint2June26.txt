What did I do last time?
-Made the initial implementations of Cd and Echo
-Made convenient getter methods from FileSystem to get specific File System
 Objects


What do I plan to do now?
-Re-implement Cd and Echo due to changes
-Create the base code for the ls, pwd, and cat classes

Am I blocked on anything?
-Initially blocked due to the initial methods from fileSystem, but after
 discussing with the group, proposals are implemented (like the getter methods)
-Pending discussion on the output class/interface; I will need to know how we
 are going to implement output for cat, ls and pwd
-Will discuss with the group if there are unexpected barriers

What did I do last time:
    - worked on JShell, Console, and ValidData (basically the prompt and user input
      handling)
    - completed the parser for splitting user input into arguments
    - brainstormed design ideas with team regarding packages, errors, and a file
      system object to be used to navigate the file system (singleton design
      principle)

What do I plan to do now?
    - clean up the documentation and code in Console and ValidData
    - work on UML for all classes with a priority on FileSystem
    - brainstorm ideas for dealing with absolute path and relative path for commands
      like mkdir

Am I blocked on anything?
    - maybe complete UML diagram for existing classes
    - maybe need to write CRC card for FileSystem
    - maybe wait for File, Directory, and FileSystem to be functional?

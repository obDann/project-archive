What did I do last time?
-Believed completion of Cd, Cat, Echo, Ls, and Pwd


What do I plan to do now?
-Modularly testing the Cd, Cat, Echo, Ls and Pwd commands (only moderately
 tested these commands)
-Assist in "attaching" my commands to the Console class
-ad-hoc documentation
-helping phase (I should be readily available)

Am I blocked on anything?
-Pending discussion on the output class/interface; I will need to know how we
 are going to implement output for cat, ls and pwd. Currently my implementation
 has it as a hard coded System.out.println statement
-Pending discussion on a root class; At the moment, there is just a default
 Directory called "root", this is because FileSystemObjects cannot be named
 "/". Will need to know implementation details since my getters inf FileSystem
 rely on this at the moment

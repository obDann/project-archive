What did I do last time:
    - made Console reflect dependency injection stuff
    - discussed with Dann how to use Output in Console

What do I plan to do now?
    - work on ! command
    - work on integrating Output with Console
    - everything basically

Am I blocked on anything?
    - just a lot of refactoring is needed, so need to think carefully about
      certain things
    - also motivate myself; this is pretty hard

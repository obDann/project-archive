What did I do last time?
- write update filesystem
- write command pathDirCommand

What do I plan to do now?
- base code for man
- base code for find

Am I blocked on anything?
- when I try to test man find class, it always gives me an system error: NullPointerEception
- need to talk to the team about how to do man class, about the format and what to include in that

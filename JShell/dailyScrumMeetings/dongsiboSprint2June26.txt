 What did I do last time:
    - finished implementing all needed features of HistoryContainer
    - added getters for history container and directory stack in Console
    - decided with team to have all commands take in a console object and array of
      command arguments in order to use polymorphism more effectively to execute
      commands in console

What do I plan to do now?
    - work on the rest of my tasks for sprint2 i.e. finish implementing command
      classes for history and man command
    - work on the calling code in Console e.g. the code for executing commands in
      general

Am I blocked on anything?
    - possibly need all commands to have a way of constructing and getting
      documentation from them (so that the man command has a way of accessing
      documentation)

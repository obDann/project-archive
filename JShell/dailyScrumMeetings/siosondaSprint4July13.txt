What did I do last time?
-Created base code for output
-Pending design on an output queue class


What do I plan to do now?
-Build and test off of the output queue class
-Integrate the output queue class into output
-Refactor assigned classes' code for output

Am I blocked on anything?
-Scarcity of time; have other priorities at the moment
-Still need to agree on the output queue class with the team

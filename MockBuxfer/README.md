# Mock Buxfer

Money management system between people and groups

### Highlights
* Pointer arithmetic
* Linked list implementations of structs
* malloc; allocating space for the heap
* Freeing memory

### Lessons learned after this project got evaluated
* Prior to freeing a node, everything that has been malloc'd in the node must be freed as well (i.e. strings)

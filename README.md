[Class Login Website [PHP]:](./ClassLoginWebsite) A website that mimics a course log-in portal for students, TAs, and instructors. This project is completed with collaborative effort from Sibo Dong

[College Admissions Problem:](./CollegeAdmissionsProblem) Originally a [paper](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf) that Gale and Shapely introduced as the [stable marriage problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcv1IqHWAzg) where objectively, there are no matches that would make heterogeneous marriages unstable (i.e. once pairings are matched, no agent will abandon their matched relationship for more benefit). By the end of Gale and Shapely's paper on the stable marriage problem, they had equate it to the college admissions problem (where student applicants match with a college). Eventually, Roth and Sotomayor debunked this statement. This is a presentation where the college admissions problem is properly defined with definitions and theorems, as well as a counter example to demonstrate that the college admissions problem is not the same as the stable marriage problem. This presentation is completed with collaborative effort from Priscilla Chan, Amanda Ng, and Zora Wang.
